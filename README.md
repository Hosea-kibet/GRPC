Welcome to my Coffee Shop gRPC Example! This project demonstrates a simple coffee shop application using gRPC for communication between a server and a client built with Go.
Overview

The Coffee Shop application includes functionalities to:

    Retrieve a menu of coffee items.
    Place orders for selected items.
    Check the status of placed orders.



Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Go (version 1.16 or later)
    Protocol Buffers Compiler (protoc)
    gRPC Go library

Installation

    Clone the Repository

    bash

git clone https://github.com/Hosea-kibet/GRPC_EXAMPLE.git
cd shop

Install Dependencies

Ensure you have all the required Go modules by running:

bash

    go mod tidy

Running the Server

    Open a terminal and navigate to the shop directory:

    bash

cd shop

Start the server:

bash

    go run server.go

The server will now be listening for incoming requests.
Running the Client

    Open another terminal and navigate to the client directory:

    bash

cd shop/client

Launch the client:

bash

    go run client.go

The client will connect to the server and retrieve the coffee menu.
Updating and Regenerating Protocol Buffers

To update your .proto files and regenerate the corresponding gRPC code, run the following command:

bash

make build_proto

Ensure that your Makefile is properly configured to handle the build_proto command.
Example .proto File

Hereâ€™s an example of what your coffee_shop.proto file might contain:

protobuf

syntax = "proto3";

package coffeshop_proto;

service CoffeeShop {
    rpc GetMenu(MenuRequest) returns (Menu);
    rpc PlaceOrder(Order) returns (Receipt);
    rpc OrderStatus(Receipt) returns (Status);
}

message MenuRequest {}

message Menu {
    repeated Item Items = 1;
}

message Item {
    string name = 1;
    float price = 2;
}

message Order {
    repeated Item Items = 1;
}

message Receipt {
    string orderId = 1;
}

message Status {
    string orderId = 1;
    string status = 2;
}
